This technique is used to prevent a directory harvest attack. &nbsp;In a directory harvest attack a spammer will attempt to send to thousands of email address at your domain trying to find real ones. When your server responds with an error (5xx), the spammer knows that it is not a real email address. When your server accepts the message (2xx), the spammer knows that was a real email address.</p>\r\n",

You will get this warning if the name you present yourself as is not in the same domain as the hostname we get when we perform a PTR lookup on your IP Address.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tFor a time many servers would &quot;mask&quot; their SMTP banners by replacing the characters with asterisks to anybody outside of their network. The logic behind this was often that you did not want to broadcast any information about your network to people outside for fear of giving them any information that might help them in an attack against your server. The benefits of doing this are minimal and many servers perform a banner check as part of spam mitigation, so it has a negative cost associated with the practice. Our tool will issue a warning if your banner is masked.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tSome receiving mail servers may use a mismatched or masked banner as an indication of a possible spam source in a scoring system, but most will not reject incoming mail solely on this basis.</p>\r\n<p>\r\n\tIf you do not have a PTR record, or your record does not match your hostname, we recommend that you contact your ISP and ask them to setup a reverse (PTR) record that matches the hostname of your mail server.</p>\r\n",
